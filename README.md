### How to obtain image

Open the Developer Tools. Press Cmd + Shift + I and type "screenshot". Select to take a screenshot of the entire website.

## To do

- Move zero back to the space bar (switch with N)
- Move ESC back to left hand (probably Caps lock and X). This will free up the original place for slash (/) which might work well.
- Move question mark and colon back to their original place (with shift).
- Move semicolon back to its original place on the number layer
- Move tab to shift + space
- Caps lock
- Cmd + Shift + Tab
- Cmd (+ Shift) + `

## To try?

Does simultaneous tab + r work? That means that the symbol layer only activates on other combination, and tab only works on release. Is that already the case?
