## Layout

There are two goals:

- Restrict as much as possible to the 30 alpha keys plus the spacebar.
- Stay as close to QWERTY as possible to not mess with muscle memory and allow easy transition to tranditional keyboards.

### How to obtain image

Resize window to 700px. Open the Developer Tools. Press Cmd + Shift + P and type "screenshot". Select to take a screenshot of the entire website.

## To do

- Remove layer switching keys from the upper layer mapping (to vk_none)
- Move tab to shift + space
- Caps lock
- Cmd (+ Shift) + `

## To try?

Does simultaneous tab + r work? That means that the symbol layer only activates on other combination, and tab only works on release. Is that already the case?
